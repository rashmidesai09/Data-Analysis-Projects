# Report for ForestQuery into Global Deforestation, 1990 to 2016 
ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. 

The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.

Through Udacity, I downloaded data from the World Bank that included forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and their corresponding region. 

I used SQL to query these tables to find areas of concern, where deforestation is high, as well as areas of success, where forestation has increased. 

By utilizing joins, subqueries, case statements and more, I developed a report that analyzed deforestation at the global, continental and country level. I also provided recommendations for future research.
