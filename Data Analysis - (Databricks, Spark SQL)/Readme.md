### Building an Azure Data Lake for Bike Share Data Analytics

#### Project Overview
This project involves building a data lake solution for Divvy bikeshare.

Divvy is a bike sharing program in Chicago, Illinois USA that allows riders to purchase a pass at a kiosk or use a mobile application to unlock a bike at stations around the city and use the bike for a specified amount of time. The bikes can be returned to the same station or to another station. The City of Chicago makes the anonymized bike trip data publicly available for projects like this where we can analyze the data.

The goal of this project is to develop a data lake solution using Azure Databricks using a lake house architecture. 

- Design a star schema based on the business outcomes listed below;
- Import the data into Azure Databricks using Delta Lake to create a Bronze data store;
- Create a gold data store in Delta Lake tables;
- Transform the data into the star schema for a Gold data store;
