## Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib for Bank Marketing Data Set (open source)

#### Objectives :

1. Explore a banking dataset with Pandas framework
2. Build pivot tables
3. Visualize the dataset with various plot types

During the work, the task of preliminary analysis is a matter of bank scoring, i.e. according to the characteristics of a client (potential client), their behavior is predicted (loan default, a wish to make a deposit, etc.).

We try to find answers to a set of questions that may be relevant when analyzing banking data:

Below are some of the sample questions 
What is the average call duration for the attracted clients?
What is the average age among the attracted and unmarried clients?
What is the average age and call duration for different types of client employment?

In addition, we will make a visual analysis in order to plan marketing banking campaigns more effectively.
